# Voice-Eliminator

Voice-Eliminator is a MATLAB-based project that focuses on frequency domain transformation of signals, including Fourier transform, low-pass filtering, and more. The primary goal is to eliminate the voice of the singer in a song.

## Features

- **Frequency Domain Transformation**: Utilize Fourier transform for signal processing.
- **Low-Pass Filtering**: Apply low-pass filters to isolate specific frequencies.
- **Voice Elimination**: Remove the singer's voice from audio tracks.
- **Channel Manipulation**: Extract and manipulate left and right audio channels.
- **Phase Reverse Mixing**: Implement phase reverse mixing techniques.
- **Filtering Compensation**: Compensate for filtering effects to enhance audio quality.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shaoting-Feng/Voice-Eliminator.git
   ```
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `Voice_Eliminator.m` script to start the voice elimination process.
